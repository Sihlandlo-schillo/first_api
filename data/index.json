    "aboutMe":["My name is Sihlandlo Makhumsha and I am a student at Life  Choices Coding Academy.",  "I was born in Cape Town on 01 December 2001, 4 years later moved to stay in the  rurals of the Eastern Cape with my grandmother who played a significant role in my life. I started my grade R there in 2007 then went to finish matric in 2019 then somehow after highschool I came back to the Western Cape. I always loved looking at different studies and their respective prospects. I applied at Life Choices in 2022 but I couldn't come to the bootcamp due to financial difficulties. This year I had to make sure at least I can come to the bootcamp and then try my best. Now I'm a beginner web developer willing to learn and unlearn where there's a need to."],
